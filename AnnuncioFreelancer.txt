For a startup website that handle online booking of sport activities we need 
a serious professional hable to handle the following tasks:
- design the logo of web site with possibly 1/2 variations both in color and in b&w
- design a color palette compatible with logo
- design the layout of general site and of about 10 page types (see below)
- provide optionally UI/UX suggestions
- provide optionally SEO suggestions

The site is composed of different sections and one or more page types per section:
1. Landing Page
2. Client Public Page: is the main page of site with different sections 
   one below the other and some banner ads. 
   This area include also a "Book for an event" page/popup
3. Client Administration Area which include the following page types:
  - List of Items
  - Item detail edit /view
  - Calendar
4. User personal area which includes the following page types:
  - personal profile edit
  - booking history
  - single booking detail
  - undo booking page
5. Signin/Signup pages  


The minimal deliverables expected are:
- logo in different formats (vetorial, raster) and resolutions both for web and print
- the color palette
- web design (see note) as HTML/CSS and optionally as PSD
- wireframes for UX

Note: 
1. The development of web site is almost completed, what we need is to improve and level out
the design and graphic part with particular attention to accessibility from mobile (responsive design).
2. We already adopted materializeCSS as CSS framework and we don't want change it.
